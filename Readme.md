# Shopping Mock Database Schema

The e-commerce database schema is designed to support the core functionalities of an online store. It provides a structured way to store and manage data related to products, customers, and orders. The schema ensures data integrity and facilitates efficient querying and reporting. 

- **Products**: Contains all the items available for purchase, including their details and stock levels.
- **Customers**: Stores customer information necessary for placing orders and communication.
- **Orders**: Tracks each purchase made by customers, recording the order date and total amount.
- **OrderDetails**: Provides granular details about each product in an order, including quantity and price.

This schema can be used as a foundation for developing an e-commerce platform, supporting functionalities like product management, order processing, and customer relationship management.



## Tech Stack

This database schema can be implemented using any SQL-based database management system. Here are some recommendations and compatible technologies:

- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**:
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - SQLite
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Oracle Database


## Relationships

Each Order is placed by a single Customer, but a Customer can place multiple Orders.
Each Order can contain multiple Products, and each Product can appear in multiple Orders. This relationship is managed through the OrderDetails table.
## Features

-**Product Management**: Store and manage details of products including descriptions, prices, and stock levels.
- **Customer Management**: Maintain comprehensive records of customer information.
- **Order Tracking**: Record orders placed by customers, including order date and total amount.
- **Order Details**: Capture detailed information about products in each order, including quantities and prices.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure relational integrity through foreign key constraints.
## Pre-requisites

To set up and use this database schema, you will need:

- A SQL-based database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Basic knowledge of SQL
- A database management tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin, pgAdmin, DBeaver)
- A programming environment for backend development (optional, for integrating with applications)

## Usage
To create the database schema, execute the provided SQL statements in your database management system. Ensure that the order of execution respects the dependencies between tables, typically starting with Products, then Customers, followed by Orders, and finally OrderDetails.
